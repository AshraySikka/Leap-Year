# Leap-Year

This Python program checks whether a given year is a **leap year** or not based on the standard leap year rules.

## 📖 What Is a Leap Year?

A year is a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4 **and** not divisible by 100, **or**
- It is divisible by 400

Leap years have 366 days, with February 29 as the extra day.

## 💡 What It Does

- Prompts the user to enter a year.
- Uses conditional statements to check leap year conditions.
- Prints `"Leap year"` if the year qualifies, otherwise prints `"Not a leap year"`.

## 📁 File

- `leap-year.py`: Contains the leap year checking logic.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python leap-year.py
